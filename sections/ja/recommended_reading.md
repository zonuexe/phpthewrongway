[PHP The Wrong Way on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12318615)

* When "PHP The Wrong Way" was launched it spawned a bunch of comments on Hacker News that has many valuable arguments worth reading.

[Why bad scientific code beats code following "best practices"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12377385)

* Simple-minded, care-free near-incompetence can be better than industrial-strength good intentions paving a superhighway to hell. The "real world" outside the computer is full of such examples.

[How to program without OOP](https://medium.com/@brianwill/how-to-program-without-oop-74a46e0e47a3#.squpnjz4n)

* As a fresh and alternative perspective Brian Will discusses in three videos why he thinks object-oriented programming is a bad idea to begin with and he finishes up the series with a couple of notes on how non-OOP code should be written.

[Coders at work - Reflections on the Craft of Programming](http://codersatwork.com/)

* Based on nearly eighty hours of conversations with fifteen all-time great programmers and computer scientists, the Q&A interviews in Coders at Work provide a multifaceted view into how great programmers learn to program, how they practice their craft, and what they think about the future of programming.

[The traits of a proficient programmer](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-traits-of-a-proficient-programmer)

* Competence means having enough experience and knowledge to get stuff done; proficiency involves knowing why you are doing something in a certain way, and how it fits into the big picture. In other words, a proficient practitioner is always a competent practitioner, but the opposite may not be true.

[OWASP Secure Coding Guidelines](https://www.owasp.org/images/0/08/OWASP_SCP_Quick_Reference_Guide_v2.pdf)

* This technology agnostic document defines a set of general software security coding practices, in a checklist format, that can be integrated into the software development life-cycle. Implementation of these practices will mitigate most common software vulnerabilities.

[Security by Design Principles](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Security_by_Design_Principles)

* Web application security is an essential component of any successful project, whether open source PHP applications, web services such as straight through processing, or proprietary business web sites. Hosters (rightly) shun insecure code, and users shun insecure services that lead to fraud. The aim of this Development Guide is to allow businesses, developers, designers and solution architects to produce secure web applications. If done from the earliest stages, secure applications cost about the same to develop as insecure applications, but are far more cost effective in the long run.

[Survive The Deep End: PHP Security](http://phpsecurity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

* As every target of a serious security breach will quickly note in their press releases and websites: Security is very important to them and take it very seriously. Taking this sentiment to heart before you learn it the hard way is recommended.

[Refactoring Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7407595M/Refactoring)

 * Refactoring is about improving the design of existing code. It is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code, yet improves its internal structure. With refactoring you can even take a bad design and rework it into a good one. This book offers a thorough discussion of the principles of refactoring, including where to spot opportunities for refactoring, and how to set up the required tests. There is also a catalog of more than 40 proven refactorings with details as to when and why to use the refactoring, step by step instructions for implementing it, and an example illustrating how it works. The book is written using Java as its principle language, but the ideas are applicable to any OO language.

[The Practice of Programming](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15333872W/The_Practice_of_Programming_%28Addison-Wesley_Professional_Computing_Series%29)

 * A compendium of practical matters of importance to working programmers.

[The pragmatic programmer](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5748544W/The_pragmatic_programmer)

 * The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master examines the core programming process: taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping code flexible, easy to adapt, and reuse.

[Understanding programming languages](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1875800W/Understanding_programming_languages)

 * The choice of a programming language is one of the most important factors that influence the ultimate quality of a software system. Unfortunately, too many programmers have poor linguistic skills: they are passionately in love with their "native" language, but are not able to analyze language constraints. "Understanding Programming Languages" is written for the purpose of explaining what alternatives are available to the language designer; how language constructs should be used in terms of safety and readability; how language constructs are implemented and which ones can be efficiently complied; and what is the role of language in expressing and enforcing abstractions.
